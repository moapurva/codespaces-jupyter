MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes Methodology | October 2022 
1 
Introduction 
The MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes (the “Indexes”) are designed to 
represent the performance of a strategy that meets the minimum standards of the 
EU Paris Aligned Benchmark (PAB) 1 and seek higher exposure to the four style 
factors - Value, Momentum, Low Size and Quality - relative to other factors from the 
relevant Barra Equity Model2 while maintaining market risk exposure similar to the 
underlying Parent Index (herein, the “Parent Index”).  
This index methodology aims to incorporate climate-based constraints in an 
optimization-based index construction approach by using risk-target optimization.

benchmarks-esg-disclosures.pdf.  In case there are changes in the EU delegated acts and an update to the Index 
methodology is required, MSCI will issue an announcement prior to implementing the changes in the 
methodology. MSCI will not conduct a formal consultation for such an update.

MSCI ESG Research 
The Indexes use company ratings and research provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC. 
In particular, these Indexes use the following three MSCI ESG Research products: 
MSCI Climate Change Ratings, MSCI ESG Controversies Score and MSCI ESG 
Business Involvement Screening Research.  
For details on MSCI ESG Research’s full suite of ESG products, please refer to: 
https://www.msci.com/esg-investing. 
2.1 
MSCI CLIMATE CHANGE METRICS 
MSCI Climate Change Metrics provides climate data & tools to support investors 
integrating climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. 
It supports investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring 
and reporting on climate risk exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel-free 
strategies, align with temperature pathways and factoring climate change research 
into their risk management processes, in particular through climate scenario analysis 
for both transition and physical risks.  
The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, 
green opportunities, physical risks and 1.5° alignment. 
For more details on MSCI Climate Change Metrics, please refer to 
https://www.msci.com/climate-solutions. 
2.2 
MSCI ESG CONTROVERSIES 
MSCI ESG Controversies provides assessments of controversies concerning the 
negative environmental, social, and/or governance impact of company operations, 
products and services. The evaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is 
designed to be consistent with international norms represented by the UN 
Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies Score falls on 
a 0-10 scale, with “0” being the most severe controversy.

Index Construction Methodology 
The Indexes are constructed based on an optimization process from the underlying 
Parent Index using a Barra Equity Model to maximize the Index-level exposure to the 
targeted style factors while maintaining market risk similar to the Parent Index and 
meeting the minimum standards of the EU Paris Aligned Benchmark (PAB). 
The steps for constructing the Indexes are described below. 
3.1 
APPLICABLE UNIVERSE 
The Applicable Universe includes all the existing constituents of an underlying MSCI 
Parent Index. The relevant Parent Index could be any MSCI Global Investable Market 
Index. 
3.2 
ELIGIBLE UNIVERSE 
The Eligible Universe is constructed by excluding securities from the Applicable 
Universe based on the exclusion criteria described below.  
3.3 
DEFINING THE EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
3.3.1 
CONTROVERSEY BASED EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Securities of companies involved in “Very Severe” business controversies as defined 
by the MSCI ESG Controversies Methodology are not eligible for inclusion in the 
Index. This is implemented by excluding securities from the Applicable Universe with 
ESG Controversy Score = 0 (‘Red Flag’ companies). 
3.3.2 
BUSINESS EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Companies that are involved in specific businesses which have high potential for 
negative social and/or environmental impact are ineligible for inclusion in the Index.  
• 
Controversial Weapons 
• 
Environmental Harm 
• 
Tobacco 
• 
Thermal Coal Mining 
• 
Oil & Gas 
• 
Power Generation 
Please refer to Appendix I for more details on these criteria.

MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes Methodology | October 2022 
3.4 
CONSTITUENT IDENTIFICATION 
The selection of constituents from the Eligible Universe is conducted through the 
process of optimization. 
The optimization relies on the factor exposures for all the securities in the Parent 
Index and the factor covariance matrix of the relevant Barra Equity Model. The 
optimization is performed using a base currency. The default currency is the US 
Dollar. 
3.5 
WEIGHTING SCHEME 
The optimization objective is to maximize the Alpha score (representative of the 
exposures to the set of target factors) under the “target risk “constraint where the 
risk target is equal to the ex-ante risk of the Parent Index at the time of rebalancing. 
3.5.1 
CALCULATION OF THE ALPHA SCORE 
 
∝i= 0.25 ∗F1,i + 0.25 ∗F2,i  + 0.25 ∗F3,i +  0.25 ∗F4,i 
Where, 
 𝐹
𝑗,𝑖= Factor exposure of each security i for each of the target factors. 
The factor exposures for the target factors are sourced as follows:  
• 
Momentum – The winsorized z-score of factor exposure for each security 
taken from the Momentum factor exposure in the relevant Barra Equity 
Model. The factor definition is given in Appendix II.  
• 
Low Size - The winsorized z-score of factor exposure for each security taken 
from the relevant Barra Equity Model. The factor definition is given in 
Appendix II.  
• 
Value – Sector-relative score calculated using the security-level exposures to 
earnings-based, asset-based and whole-firm based valuation metrics from 
the relevant Barra Equity Model. The factor definition is given in Appendix II.  
• 
Quality – Sector-relative score calculated using the security-level exposures 
to all Quality factors from the relevant Barra Equity Model. The factor 
definition is given in Appendix II.  
3.6 
OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS 
At each Quarterly Index Review (QIR), the following optimization constraints are 
employed, which aim to ensure investability while achieving total risk in line with that 
of the Parent Index:

MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes Methodology | October 2022 
• 
If the Parent Index is an MSCI Standard Index or MSCI Investable Market Index 
(IMI), then the maximum weight of an Index constituents that belong to the Large 
Cap size segment will be restricted to the lower of (the weight of the security in 
the Parent Index + 2%) and 10 times the weight of the security in the Parent 
Index. The minimum weight of an Index constituent will be restricted to the 
higher of the (weight of the security in the Parent Index - 2%) and 0. The 
maximum weight of an Index constituents that belong to the Mid Cap or Small 
Cap size segments will be restricted to the lower of (the weight of the security in 
the Parent Index + 1%) or 5 times the weight of the security in the Parent Index. 
The minimum weight of an Index constituent will be restricted to the higher of the 
(weight of the security in the Parent Index - 1%) or 0. 
• 
If the Parent Index is an MSCI Mid Cap index or an MSCI Small Cap index, the 
maximum weight of an Index constituent will be restricted to the lower of (the 
weight of the security in the Parent Index + 1%) and 5 times the weight of the 
security in the Parent Index. The minimum weight of an Index constituent will be 
restricted to the higher of (the weight of the security in the Parent Index - 1%) and 
0. 
• 
Active exposure of the Index to the target Barra style factors (factors included in 
the calculation of Alpha score) will be constrained to be greater than 0.1 and less 
than 0.6. Factors, namely, Earnings Variability, Leverage, Size, Beta and Residual 
Volatility if included in the calculation of Alpha score, will be constrained to be 
greater than -0.6 and less than -0.1 relative to the Parent Index. 
• 
The exposure of the Index to the non-target Barra style factors will be restricted 
to +/-0.1 standard deviations relative to the Parent Index. 
• 
The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®)3 sector weights of the Index 
will not deviate more than +/- 5% from the sector weights of the Parent Index (the 
Energy GICS Sector is not constrained). 
• 
For countries with weight greater than 2.5% in the Parent Index, the weight in the 
Index will not deviate more than +/-5% from the country weight in the Parent 
Index. 
• 
For countries with weight less than 2.5% in the Parent Index, the weight in the 
Index will be capped at 3 times their weight in the Parent Index. 
• 
The above country weight constraint will also apply on China A Stock Connect 
listings as a group separately in addition to the usual country weight constraint 
on China. 
• 
The one-way turnover of the Index is constrained to a maximum of 10% at each 
QIR.

Table 1: Constraints imposed to meet climate objectives 
 
3.7 
DETERMINING THE OPTIMIZED INDEX  
The MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes are constructed using the 
Barra Open Optimizer in combination with the relevant Barra Equity Model6. The 
optimization uses the Eligible Universe and the Applicable Universe and the specified 
optimization objective and constraints to determine the constituents and the weights 
of the Index. The Eligible Universe is used to determine the securities eligible in the 
Index and the Applicable Universe is used to define other constraints like “target 
risk”. Infeasible optimizations are handled as explained in Appendix V. 
 
 
 
4 Prior to the May 2020 Semi-Annual Index Review (SAIR) of the Indexes, the Weighted Average Carbon 
Emissions Intensity relative to EVIC has been calculated based on Scope 1+2 Emissions.  
5 Prior to the May 2020 Semi-Annual Index Review (SAIR) of the Indexes, the average reduction in Weighted 
Average Carbon Emissions Intensity relative to EVIC has been calculated using Scope 1+2 Emissions since 
Inception.

Maintaining the Indexes 
4.1 
QUARTERLY INDEX REVIEWS 
The MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes are rebalanced on a quarterly 
basis, usually as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August and 
November, coinciding with the regular Index Reviews (Semi-Annual Index Reviews in 
May and November and Quarterly Index Reviews in February and August) of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. The Barra Equity Model data as of the day before 
the rebalancing day is used. This approach aims to capture timely updates to the risk 
characteristics of the companies and coincide with the rebalancing frequency of the 
relevant Parent Index.  
In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data (including MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics, MSCI ESG Controversies and MSCI Business Involvement Screening 
Research) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the 
rebalancing of the Indexes.  
The pro forma MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes are in general 
announced nine business days before the effective date. 
4.2 
ONGOING EVENT RELATED CHANGES   
The general treatment of corporate events in the Indexes aims to minimize turnover 
outside of Index Reviews. The methodology aims to appropriately represent an 
investor’s participation in an event based on relevant deal terms and pre-event 
weighting of the Index constituents that are involved. Further, changes in Index 
market capitalization that occur as a result of corporate event implementation will be 
offset by a corresponding change in the Variable Weighting Factor (VWF) of the 
constituent. 
Additionally, if the frequency of Index Reviews in the Parent Index is greater than the 
frequency of Index Reviews in the Index, the changes made to the Parent Index 
during intermediate Index Reviews will be neutralized in the Index. 
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events 
within the Index. 
No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between 
Index Reviews. Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously.

MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes Methodology | October 2022 
EVENT TYPE 
 
 
 
 
EVENT DETAILS 
 
 
 
New additions to the Parent Index 
A new security added to the Parent 
Index (such as IPO and other early 
inclusions) will not be added to the 
Index. 
 
Spin-Offs 
All securities created as a result of the 
spin-off of an existing Index 
constituent will be added to the Index 
at the time of event implementation. 
Reevaluation for continued inclusion 
in the Index will occur at the 
subsequent Index Review. 
 
Merger/Acquisition 
For Mergers and Acquisitions, the 
acquirer’s post event weight will 
account for the proportionate amount 
of shares involved in deal 
consideration, while cash proceeds 
will be invested across the Index. 
 
If an existing Index constituent is 
acquired by a non-Index constituent, 
the existing constituent will be deleted 
from the Index and the acquiring non-
constituent will not be added to the 
Index. 
 
Changes in Security Characteristics 
A security will continue to be an Index 
constituent if there are changes in 
characteristics (country, sector, size 
segment, etc.) Reevaluation for 
continued inclusion in the Index will 
occur at the subsequent Index Review. 
 
Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events 
relevant to this Index can be found in the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology book 
under the sections detailing the treatment of events in Capped Weighted and Non-
Market Capitalization Weighted Indexes.   
The MSCI Corporate Events methodology book is available at:

MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Indexes Methodology | October 2022 
Appendix II: Target Factor Definition Summary 
The style factors targeted in the MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB Index are 
the four style factor families and their combinations: Value, Quality, Momentum and 
Low Size. These factor families are described using individual factor scores from the 
current release of the MSCI Barra Equity Model. The choice of factors used within 
each factor family is governed by the current model used for the optimization, which 
may change with a new release of the Barra Equity Model (as specified in Appendix 
IV). The model data will be used from a day prior to the rebalancing date. All factor 
exposures are re-normalized at the Parent Index level prior to the calculation of the 
Alpha score. Following are the definitions of factor families currently used in the 
Index. For more detailed information on individual factors in GEMLTL, please refer to 
https://www.msci.com/portfolio-management. 
Value: 
The Value score for each security is calculated by combining the security-level 
exposures to two factors, Book-to-Price and Earnings Yield, from the relevant Barra 
Equity Model (currently GEMLTL). A sector-relative score is derived from the 
combined score by standardizing (z-score) the latter within each sector and 
winsorizing at +/- 3. 
Valuei = (0.33) ∗BtoP
i + (0.67) ∗EarningsYieldi 
Quality: 
The Quality score for each security is calculated by combining in equal 
proportion the security-level exposures to five factors - Profitability, Investment 
Quality, Earnings Quality, Leverage and Earnings Variability - from the relevant 
Barra Equity Model (currently GEMLTL). A sector-relative score is derived from 
the combined score by standardizing (z-score) the latter within each sector and 
winsorizing at +/- 3. 
Qualityi = (0.2) ∗Profitabilityi + (0.2) ∗Investment Qualityi + (0.2) ∗Earnings Qualityi
+ (−1) ∗(0.2) ∗Earnings Variabilityi + (−1) ∗(0.2) ∗Leveragei 
Momentum: 
The Momentum score for each security is the standardized (z-score) Momentum 
factor score from the relevant Barra Equity Model (currently GEMLTL) within the 
Parent Index and winsorized at +/- 3. 
Low Size: 
The Low Size score for each security is the standardized (z-score) Size factor score 
with sign reversed from the relevant Barra Equity Model (currently GEMLTL) within 
the Parent Index and winsorized at +/- 3. 
Low Sizei = −(1)Sizei

Appendix III: Calculation of Target Metrics 
Calculation of GHG Intensity relative to EVIC 
For Parent Index constituents where the Scope 1+2+3 Emissions Intensity is not 
available, the average Scope 1+2+3 Emissions Intensity of all the constituents of the 
MSCI ACWI in the same GICS Industry Group in which the constituent belongs is 
used.  
Security Level GHG Intensity =

Weighted Average GHG Intensity of Parent Index = 
 
∑(𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦) 
 
Weighted Average GHG Intensity of Derived Index =   
∑(𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦) 
 
Calculation of Average Decarbonization 
On average, the Indexes follow a 7% decarbonization trajectory since the Base Date. 
The Weighted Average GHG Intensity relative to EVIC at the Base Date (W1) is used to 
compute the target Weighted Average GHG Intensity relative to EVIC at any given Semi-
Annual Index Review (Wt) as per the below formula. 
𝑊

Where ‘t’ is the number of Semi-Annual Index Reviews since the Base Date.  
Thus, for the 3rd Semi-Annual Index Review since the Base Date (t=3), the target 
Weighted Average GHG Intensity relative to EVIC will be W1*0.93. 
Calculation of GHG Intensity relative to Sales 
For Parent Index constituents where the Scope 1+2+3 Emissions Intensity is not 
available, the average Scope 1+2+3 Emissions Intensity of all the constituents of the

Climate Impact Sectors 
NACE8 is the European Union’s classification of economic activities. As per the draft 
DA, stocks in the NACE Section codes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, L are classified as “High 
Climate Impact” sector and other stocks are classified ‘Low Climate Impact’ sector. 
The GICS9 Sub-Industry code for each security is mapped to the corresponding 
“Climate Impact Sector” using a mapping. This mapping is constructed in the 
following steps: 
1. MSCI has published a mapping10 between the NACE classes and GICS Sub-
Industry.  
2. For each GICS Sub-Industry, the number of NACE classes which fall under the 
High Climate Impact Sector (say the number of classes is NH) and Low 
Climate Impact Sector (say the number of classes is NL) is identified. 
3. If all the NACE classes for a given GICS Sub-Industry are identified in the High 
Climate Impact Sector (NL = 0), then the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the 
High Climate Impact Sector. Conversely, if all the NACE classes for a given 
GICS Sub-Industry are identified in the Low Climate Impact Sector (NH = 0) 
then the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the Low Climate Impact Sector. 
4. In case a GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to some NACE classes in the High 
Climate Impact Sector and the others in the Low Climate Impact Sector, the 
GICS Industry is mapped to the Climate Impact Sector in the following 
manner: 
a. NH >= NL: If the number of NACE classes in the High Climate Impact 
Sector is at least equivalent to the number of NACE classes in the 
Low Climate Impact Sector, the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the 
High Climate Impact Sector. 
 
8 For further details regarding NACE, please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-
explained/index.php?title=NACE_background 
9 For further information regarding GICS, please refer to https://www.msci.com/gics

b. NH < NL: If the number of NACE classes in the High Climate Impact 
Sector is less than the number of NACE classes in the Low Climate 
Impact Sector, the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the Low Climate 
Impact Sector. 
5. Using the GICS Sub-Industry to Climate Impact Sector mapping created in 
Step 4, and the security-level GICS Sub-Industry, each security in the Parent 
Index is classified in either High Climate Impact Sector or Low Climate 
Impact Sector.

Appendix IV: New release of Barra® Equity Model or 
Barra® Optimizer 
The methodology presently uses MSCI Barra Global Equity Model for Long-Term 
Investors (“GEMLTL”) for the optimization. A new release of the relevant Barra Equity 
Model or Barra Optimizer may replace the former version within a suitable 
timeframe.

Appendix V: Handling Infeasible Optimizations 
During the Quarterly Index Review, in the event that there is no optimal solution that 
satisfies all the optimization constraints defined in Section 3.6, the following 
constraints will be relaxed, until an optimal solution is found: 
• 
Relax the maximum weight multiple in steps of 2 for the Large Cap size 
segment and in steps of 1 for the Mid Cap and Small Cap size segments, up 
to a maximum of 5 iterations based upon the following formula: 
𝑤𝑚i+1= step + 𝑤𝑚i 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖 = 0 − 4 
Where 𝑤𝑚i = Maximum Active weight multiple 
𝑤𝑚0 = 10 and step=2 for the Large Cap size segment 
𝑤𝑚0 = 5 and step=1 for the Mid Cap and Small Cap size segment 
• 
Relax the turnover constraint in steps of 2%, up to a maximum of 20%.  
• 
The maximum weight multiple constraint and the maximum turnover 
constraint are alternately relaxed until a feasible solution is achieved. For 
example, constraints relaxation is executed in the sequence as illustrated 
below:  
 
In the event that no optimal solution is found after the above constraints have been 
relaxed over all the iterations, the relevant MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor EU PAB 
Index will not be rebalanced for that Quarterly Index Review.

None of the Information constitutes an offer to sell (or a solicitation of an offer to buy), any security, financial product or other investment vehicle or any trading strategy.  
It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is only available through third party investable 
instruments (if any) based on that index.   MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express any opinion regarding any fund, ETF, derivative or other 
security, investment, financial product or trading strategy that is based on, linked to or seeks to provide an investment return related to the performance of any MSCI index (collectively, 
“Index Linked Investments”). MSCI makes no assurance that any Index Linked Investments will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns.  MSCI Inc. is not 
an investment adviser or fiduciary and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any Index Linked Investments. 
Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates indexes but does not manage actual assets. Index returns do not 
reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments. The imposition of these fees and charges 
would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI index performance. 
The Information may contain back tested data.  Back-tested performance is not actual performance but is hypothetical.  There are frequently material differences between back tested 
performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.   
Constituents of MSCI equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the application of the relevant index methodologies. 
Accordingly, constituents in MSCI equity indexes may include MSCI Inc., clients of MSCI or suppliers to MSCI.  Inclusion of a security within an MSCI index is not a recommendation by 
MSCI to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice. 
Data and information produced by various affiliates of MSCI Inc., including MSCI ESG Research LLC and Barra LLC, may be used in calculating certain MSCI indexes.  More information can 
be found in the relevant index methodologies on www.msci.com.  
MSCI receives compensation in connection with licensing its indexes to third parties.  MSCI Inc.’s revenue includes fees based on assets in Index Linked Investments. Information can be
