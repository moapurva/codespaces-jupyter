Introduction 
The MSCI India ESG Enhanced Focus CTB Select Index (the ‘Index’) is designed to 
maximize exposure to positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors 
while maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to those of MSCI India (the 
‘Parent Index’).  
The Index is constructed by selecting constituents of the Parent Index through an 
optimization process that aims to maximize exposure to ESG factors for a target 
tracking error budget and exceed the minimum standards of the EU Climate 
Transition Benchmark (CTB).  
The Index is constructed following an optimization-based approach and aims to: 
 
• 
Exceed the minimum technical requirements laid out for EU Climate 
Transition Benchmarks in the EU Delegated Acts1  
• 
Reduce the weighted average greenhouse gas intensity by 30% (compared to 
the underlying investment universe 
• 
Reduce the weighted average greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity by 7% on an 
annualized basis 
• 
Reduce the weighted average potential emissions intensity by 30% 
(compared to the underlying investment universe) 
• 
Have at least equivalent ratio of weighted average “Green Revenues” to 
weighted average “Fossil Fuels-based Revenues” as that of the underlying 
investment universe 
• 
Increase the weight of companies with credible carbon reduction targets 
through the weighting scheme  
• 
Be sector-diversified and target companies with high ESG ratings in each 
sector

Constructing the MSCI India ESG Enhanced Focus CTB 
Select Index 
The Index is constructed from the MSCI India Index. 
The construction of the Index further involves the following steps: 
• 
Defining the exclusion criteria 
• 
Defining the optimization constraints 
• 
Determining the optimized portfolio 
The steps mentioned above are defined in detail in the subsequent sections. 
 
3.1 
DEFINING THE EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Securities of companies involved in Very Severe business controversies as defined 
by the MSCI ESG Controversies Methodology are not eligible for inclusion in the 
Index. This is implemented by excluding constituents of the Parent Index with ESG 
Controversy Score = 0 (‘Red Flag’ companies). 
3.1.1 
BUSINESS EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Companies that are involved in specific businesses which have high potential for 
negative social and/or environmental impact are ineligible for inclusion in the Index.  
• 
Controversial Weapons 
• 
Nuclear Weapons 
• 
Civilian Firearms  
• 
Tobacco 
• 
Thermal Coal 
• 
Conventional Weapons 
• 
Unconventional Oil and Gas 
In addition to the above, companies that fail to comply with the United Nations 
Global Compact Principles are also excluded from the Index.

MSCI.COM | PAGE 7 OF 23 
© 2022 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. 
 
In addition, companies with an Environment Controversy Score2 of 0 or 1 will also be 
excluded from the Index. 
Please refer to Appendix 1 for more details on these criteria. 
OTHER EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
• 
Missing Controversy Score – Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG 
Research’s MSCI ESG Controversy Scores are excluded from the Index. 
• 
Missing ESG Rating or ESG Score – Companies which are not rated by MSCI 
ESG Research for an MSCI ESG Rating are excluded from the Index. 
3.2 
OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS 
The optimization process aims to maximize the Index’s exposure to ESG scores for a 
given tracking error budget. ESG scores are normalized and used in the optimization 
process. The following ex-ante tracking error target is used for the construction of 
the Index – 
MSCI ESG Enhanced Focus CTB Index 
Ex-Ante Tracking Error 
MSCI India ESG Enhanced Focus CTB Select Index 
1.5% 
 
Normalization of the ESG scores is designed to allow the optimization process to 
assess each score in the context of the overall distribution of the ESG scores.  
Please refer to Appendix 2 for the optimization constraints. The definitions of the 
target metrics for the optimization are detailed in Appendix 4. 
3.3 
DETERMINING THE OPTIMIZED INDEX 
The Index is constructed using the Barra Open Optimizer3 in combination with the 
relevant Barra Equity Model. The optimization uses the universe of eligible securities 
and the specified optimization objectives and constraints to determine the 
constituents of the Index. 
 
 
2 This ESG pillar is an assessment of controversies (if any) related to a firm’s impact on the environment. Factors affecting 
this evaluation include whether a company is involved in controversies related to land use and biodiversity, toxic spills 
and releases, energy and climate change, water management, operational non-hazardous waste, and management of 
supply chain environmental impact. MSCI Environment Controversy Score falls on a 0-10 scale, with “0” being the most 
severe controversy.

Maintaining MSCI India ESG Enhanced Focus CTB 
Select Index 
4.1 
QUARTERLY INDEX REVIEWS 
The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index 
Reviews (Semi-Annual Index Reviews in May and November and Quarterly Index 
Reviews in February and August) of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. 
Changes are implemented at the end of February, May, August and November. The 
pro forma Index is in general announced nine business days before the effective 
date. 
ESG scores used for the Quarterly Index Reviews will be taken as of the end of the 
month preceding the Index Review, i.e., January, April, July, and October. 
At each Index Review, the optimization process outlined in Section 3 is implemented. 
In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI 
ESG Controversies Scores, MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research, MSCI 
Climate Change Metrics, and MSCI ESG Sustainable Impact Metrics) as of the end of 
the month preceding the Index Reviews. For some securities, such data may not be 
published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the Index 
Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available. 
4.2 
ONGOING EVENT-RELATED MAINTENANCE 
The general treatment of corporate events in the Index aims to minimize turnover 
outside of Index Reviews. The methodology aims to appropriately represent an 
investor’s participation in an event based on relevant deal terms and pre-event 
weighting of the Index constituents that are involved.  Further, changes in Index 
market capitalization that occur as a result of corporate event implementation will be 
offset by a corresponding change in the Variable Weighting Factor (VWF) of the 
constituent.  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events 
within the MSCI India ESG Enhanced Focus CTB Select Index. No new securities will 
be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. Parent 
Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously.

EVENT TYPE 
 
 
 
 
EVENT DETAILS 
 
 
 
New additions to the Parent Index 
A new security added to the Parent 
Index (such as IPO and other early 
inclusions) will not be added to the 
Index. 
 
Spin-Offs 
All securities created as a result of the 
spin-off of an existing Index 
constituent will be added to the Index 
at the time of event implementation. 
Reevaluation for continued inclusion 
in the Index will occur at the 
subsequent Index Review. 
 
Merger/Acquisition 
For Mergers and Acquisitions, the 
acquirer’s post event weight will 
account for the proportionate amount 
of shares involved in deal 
consideration, while cash proceeds 
will be invested across the Index. 
 
If an existing Index constituent is 
acquired by a non-Index constituent, 
the existing constituent will be deleted 
from the Index and the acquiring non-
constituent will not be added to the 
Index. 
 
Changes in Security Characteristics 
A security will continue to be an Index 
constituent if there are changes in 
characteristics (country, sector, size 
segment, etc.) Reevaluation for 
continued inclusion in the Index will 
occur at the subsequent Index Review. 
 
Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events 
relevant to this Index can be found in the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology book 
under the sections detailing the treatment of events in Capped Weighted and Non-
Market Capitalization Weighted Indexes.

Diversification Constraints 
 
* Active Country Weights – In case there are countries in the Parent Index which 
weigh less than 2.5% in the Parent Index, then for such countries the active country 
upper bound of +5% is not applicable. When a country weighs less than 2.5% in the 
Parent Index then the upper bound of country weight in the MSCI India ESG Enhanced 
Focus CTB Select Index is set at three times of the country’s weight in the Parent 
Index. 
 
^ The Optimization Constraints are applied relative to the Parent Index. 
 
 
Infeasible Solution –  
 
During the Semi-Annual or Quarterly Index Review, in the event that there is no 
optimal solution that satisfies all the optimization constraints, the following 
constraints will be relaxed, until an optimal solution is found: 
• 
The turnover constraint will be relaxed up to a maximum of 5 times of the 
original turnover budget in steps of 5%.

Calculation of Average Decarbonization 
On average, the Index follows a 7% decarbonization trajectory since the Base Date. 
The Weighted Average GHG Intensity at the Base Date (W1) is used to compute the 
target Weighted Average GHG Intensity at any given Quarterly Index Review (Wt) as per 
the below formula. 
𝑊
𝑡= 𝑊
1 ∗  0.93
(𝑡−1)
4  
Where ‘t’ is the number of Quarterly Index Reviews since the Base Date.  
Thus, for the 5th Quarterly Index Review since the Base Date (t=5), the target Weighted 
Average GHG Intensity will be W1*0.93. 
 
Companies Setting Targets 
Relative to their corresponding Parent Index, the Index requires a minimum 20% 
increase in the aggregate weight of companies setting emissions reduction targets  
• 
companies publishing emissions reduction targets 
•

reduce carbon and pollutant emissions in supporting affordable and clean 
energy to combat climate change.  
• 
Energy Efficiency – products, and services that support the maximization of 
productivity in labor, transportation, power and domestic applications with 
minimal energy consumption to ensure universal access to affordable, 
reliable and modern energy services.  
• 
Sustainable Water – products, services, infrastructure projects and 
technologies that resolve water scarcity and water quality issues, through 
minimizing and monitoring current water demand, improving the quality and 
availability of water supply to improve resource management in both 
domestic and industrial use.  
• 
Green Building – design, construction, redevelopment, retrofitting, or 
acquisition of green-certified properties to promote mechanisms for raising 
capacity for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.  
• 
Pollution Prevention – products, services, infrastructure projects and 
technologies that reduces volume of waste materials through recycling, 
minimizes introduction of toxic substances, and offers remediation of 
existing contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants in 
various environmental media to significantly address pollution in all levels 
and its negative effects.  
• 
Sustainable Agriculture - revenues from forest and agricultural products that 
meet environmental and organic certification requirements to address 
significantly biodiversity loss, pollution, land disturbance, and water overuse. 
The Weighted Average Green Revenue% is calculated as:  
= ∑(𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥∗ 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒%) 
Fossil fuels-based Revenue 
For each constituent in the Parent Index, the Fossil fuels-based Revenue% is 
calculated as the cumulative revenue (%) from the following sources: 
• 
Revenue% (either reported or estimated) from the mining of thermal coal 
(including lignite, bituminous, anthracite and steam coal) and its sale to 
external parties. It excludes revenue from metallurgical coal, coal mined for 
internal power generation (e.g. in the case of vertically integrated power 
producers), intra-company sales of mined thermal coal and revenue from 
coal trading (either reported or estimated).

• 
Revenue% from the extraction, production and refining of Conventional and 
Unconventional Oil & Gas. Conventional Oil and Gas includes Arctic 
onshore/offshore, deep water, shallow water and other onshore/offshore. 
Unconventional Oil and Gas includes oil sands, oil shale (kerogen-rich 
deposits), shale gas, shale oil, coal seam gas, and coal bed methane. 
• 
Revenue% from thermal coal based power generation, liquid fuel based 
power generation and natural gas based power generation. 
The Weighted Average Fossil fuels-based Revenue% is calculated as:  
= ∑(𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥∗ 𝐹𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑙 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙𝑠−𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒%) 
The Green Revenues to Fossil fuels-based Revenues multiple for either the Parent 
Index or the Index is calculated as a ratio of the Weighted Average Green Revenue to 
the Weighted Average Fossil fuels-based Revenue as per the formula below: 
= 
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒%
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝐹𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑙 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙𝑠−𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒% 
 
Climate Impact Sectors 
NACE6 is the European Union’s classification of economic activities. As per the draft 
DA, stocks in the NACE Section codes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, L are classified as “High 
Climate Impact” sector and other stocks are classified ‘Low Climate Impact’ sector. 
The GICS Sub-Industry code for each security is mapped to the corresponding 
“Climate Impact Sector” using a mapping. This mapping is constructed in the 
following steps: 
1. MSCI has published a mapping7 between the NACE classes and GICS Sub-
Industry.  
2. For each GICS Sub-Industry, the number of NACE classes which fall under the 
High Climate Impact Sector (say the number of classes is NH) and Low 
Climate Impact Sector (say the number of classes is NL) is identified. 
3. If all the NACE classes for a given GICS Sub-Industry are identified in the High 
Climate Impact Sector (NL = 0), then the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the 
 
6 For further details regarding NACE, please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-
explained/index.php?title=NACE_background

High Climate Impact Sector. Conversely, if all the NACE classes for a given 
GICS Sub-Industry are identified in the Low Climate Impact Sector (NH = 0) 
then the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the Low Climate Impact Sector. 
4. In case a GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to some NACE classes in the High 
Climate Impact Sector and the others in the Low Climate Impact Sector, the 
GICS Industry is mapped to the Climate Impact Sector in the following 
manner: 
a. NH >= NL: If the number of NACE classes in the High Climate Impact 
Sector is at least equivalent to the number of NACE classes in the 
Low Climate Impact Sector, the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the 
High Climate Impact Sector. 
b. NH < NL: If the number of NACE classes in the High Climate Impact 
Sector is less than the number of NACE classes in the Low Climate 
Impact Sector, the GICS Sub-Industry is mapped to the Low Climate 
Impact Sector. 
Using the GICS Sub-Industry to Climate Impact Sector mapping created in Step 4, and 
the security-level GICS Sub-Industry, each security in the Parent Index is classified in 
either High Climate Impact Sector or Low Climate Impact Sector.

It is not possible to invest directly in an Index.  Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an Index is only available through third party investable 
instruments (if any) based on that Index.   MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express any opinion regarding any fund, ETF, derivative or other security,

adviser or fiduciary and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any Index Linked Investments.

reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the Index or Index Linked Investments. The imposition of these fees and charges 
would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI Index performance.

or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.
