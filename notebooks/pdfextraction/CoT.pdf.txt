All Experimental Results
This section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all
benchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.
For the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced)
were correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly. A similar observation
was made in Cobbe et al. (2021). Hence, we can further add a Python program as an external
calculator (using the Python eval function) to all the equations in the generated chain of thought.
When there are multiple equations in a chain of thought, we propagate the external calculator results
from one equation to the following equations via string matching. As shown in Table 1, we see that
adding a calculator signiﬁcantly boosts performance of chain-of-thought prompting on most tasks.
Table 1: Chain of thought prompting outperforms standard prompting for various large language
models on ﬁve arithmetic reasoning benchmarks. All metrics are accuracy (%). Ext. calc.: post-hoc
external calculator for arithmetic computations only. Prior best numbers are from the following. a:
Cobbe et al. (2021). b & e: Pi et al. (2022), c: Lan et al. (2021), d: Pi˛
ekos et al. (2021).
